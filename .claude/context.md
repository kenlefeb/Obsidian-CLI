# Session Context

## Current Goal

Review existing codebase and create baseline unit tests to establish test coverage before moving forward with Test-Driven Development.

## Session Date

2026-01-17

## Background

The Obsidian CLI project now follows XP practices with TDD. However, existing code was written before TDD adoption. We need to:
- Review what functionality exists
- Identify what's currently tested
- Write tests for existing code to establish a baseline
- Ensure we have a safety net before refactoring or adding features

## What We're Doing

Reviewing the Domain layer to understand:
1. What classes and methods exist
2. What behaviors need testing
3. What test coverage gaps exist
4. Creating a plan to write baseline tests for existing functionality
